wrangling visuals for covid19 data display

So far this just pulls the data from the Johns Hopkins initiative and does some basic graphing and comparisons. As a result, this data cannot be used for commercial purposed (my company is in my github name, but this isn't a commercial endeavor). Particularly interesting to me in this is that I like to understand a bit about time-resolved data, and the flat display of other dashboards doesn't really communicate that. 

# TODOS
I can think of a few features that should be added.
1. Dependencies - will sort that out to make this easier on others to run - but so far nothing exotic is necessary. It's clearly going to be easier to run this on a *nix-based system (`wget` is used).
2. Features - I'd like to add lagged-comparison to make CFR more meaningful - though this is questionable because insufficient testing across many countries makes this hard to interpret. But I'd like to at least capture the information.
3. I'm a newb with plotly - clearly there are ways to make this better but I'm actively exploring. 
4. Calculations of R0 over different windows. Thoughts on this are that early R0s cannot be accurate given that testing is largely inadequate globally at the moment (with obvious exceptions). Will think about / look into different subsampling. Also, as social distancing and other control methods are implemented, the natural expectation is that this should reduce the rate of spread / R0. It would be nice to add visuals/calculations that can reflect this.
